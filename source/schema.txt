Schema Tab
----------

The :guilabel:`Schema` tab reports on the documents in the collections.
The report is based on :ref:`sampling of the documents
<compass-faq-sampling>` in the collection.

To access the :guilabel:`Schema` tab for a collection, click on a
collection on the left hand pane and select the :guilabel:`Schema` tab.

Charts
------

For a field, Compass displays the data types and values with various
charts. The data type information is on the left hand side; the field
value information is on the right.

Field with Single Type Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an example of a chart showing a field called ``last_login``
which contains data of type ``date``.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-example.png
   :figwidth: 330px

Field with Multiple Type Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The charts also display a percentage breakdown for fields with varying
data types across documents. In the example below,
the chart shows the contents of a field called ``phone_no`` in which
81% of documents are of type ``string``, and the remaining 19% are of
type ``number``.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-percentage-breakdown.png
   :figwidth: 330px

Missing Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a collection contains documents in which not all fields contain
a value, the missing values display as ``undefined``. In the example
below, the field ``age`` has no recorded value in 40% of the sampled
documents.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-sparsity.png
   :figwidth: 330px

Strings
~~~~~~~

Strings can appear in three different ways. If there are
entirely unique strings in a field, Compass shows a random
selection of string values from the specified field. Click
the circular refresh icon to see
a new set of randomly selected values from the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-sample.png
   :figwidth: 609px

If there are only a few different string values,
Compass shows the strings in a single graded bar which
shows the percentage of the population of the string values.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-sample2.png
   :figwidth: 620px

If there are multiple string values with some duplicates,
Compass shows a histogram indicating the frequency of
each string found within the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-sample3.png
   :figwidth: 615px

.. note::

   Move the mouse over each bar to display a tooltip which shows the
   value of the string.

Numbers
~~~~~~~

Numbers are similar to strings in their representation.
Entirely unique numbers are shown in the following manner:

.. figure:: /images/compass/number-sample.png
   :figwidth: 521px

Duplicate numbers are shown in a histogram that indicates their
frequency:

.. figure:: /images/compass/number-sample2.png
   :figwidth: 529px

Sub-documents and Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that contain a sub-document or an array are displayed with
a small triangle next to them and a visual representation of the
data contained within the sub-document or array.

.. figure:: /images/compass/subdocument-sample.png
   :figwidth: 572px

Click on the triangle to expand the field and view the sub-documents
within:

.. figure:: /images/compass/subdocument-sample2.png
   :figwidth: 639px

Dates and ObjectIDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that represent dates (and fields that contain the ObjectID
data type, which includes a timestamp) are shown across multiple
bar charts. The two charts on the top row represent the day of the
week and time of day of the timestamp value.

The single chart on the bottom shows the first and last timestamp
value, and the vertical lines represent the distribution of the
timestamp across the range of first to last.

.. figure:: /images/compass/date-sample.png
   :figwidth: 615px

View Charts of Mixed Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a field has mixed types, you can view different
charts of each type by clicking on the ``type`` field.
In the example below, the ``age`` field shows its values
as a string:

.. figure:: /images/compass/mixed-sample.png
   :figwidth: 602px

Clicking on the ``number`` type causes the chart to show
the data as a number:

Query the Collection
--------------------

There are two methods for building queries in Compass. You can
automatically generate queries with the Compass query builder or you
can type the query manually in the filter bar.

Use the Query Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Click the chart values that you wish to include in a query

   Each range of bars in the charts is clickable. Click on the chart
   value and it builds a query with the correct MongoDB syntax in the
   query bar. The example below shows how to create a query for all
   documents where **EWR** is the departure airport by clicking the
   **EWR** value in the chart for the ``departureAirportFsCode`` field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-builder.png
   :figwidth: 740px

   Clicking on other field values creates a more complex query. The
   following example shows how to extend the previous query to include
   a flight ID.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-builder2.png
   :figwidth: 740px


   It is also possible to select multiple values within the same field
   by either clicking and dragging the cursor over a selection of
   values, or by shift+clicking on the desired values.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-builder3.png
   :figwidth: 740px

   You can also deselect a previously selected value by shift+clicking
   on the highlighted value:

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-builder4.png
   :figwidth: 740px

2. Click the Apply button and view the updated results

   To run the query, click the Apply button. You can clear your query
   by pressing the reset button.


The other method of building queries is to manually type the query in
the filter bar. It is also possible to compose the initial query by
using the clickable query builder and then manually editing the
generated query to refine it to your exact requirements. Composing
``$OR`` queries is not yet possible with the clickable query builder,
but you can be manually enter them in the query bar.

Type the Query in the Filter Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Type the query you wish to run in the filter bar.

   You can type MongoDB queries into the query bar of Compass. These
   queries are executed as find only, and must be valid MongoDB syntax.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-bar.png
   :figwidth: 740px

   The query bar will remain red until a valid query is entered, at
   which point it will turn green and the query can proceed. The
   Compass screen updates to indicate which field/value has been
   selected in the query.

   The results of the query are from a sampled set of documents, unless
   the query is granular enough to provide results under the sample
   threshold. In that case, the data from the entire result set is used.

Known issues:

- It is not possible to append a sort or a limit onto the end of your
  query.
- Aggregation framework queries are not yet supported.
- ``$text`` and ``$elemMatch`` are not yet supported.
- Non-standard BSON types such as ``Timestamp`` and ``MinKey`` must be
  entered using strict
  :manual:`extended JSON </reference/mongodb-extended-json/>` syntax.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { foo : { $timestamp : { $t : 1234, $i : 12 } } }

2. Click the Apply button and view the updated results

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-builder5.png
   :figwidth: 740px

As the above image shows, Compass updates its results to match the
query that was run. In this case, the query found documents where the
airport departure code was ``LGA``.

Click the Reset button to clear the results of the query.

Geographic visualization and query builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compass detects GeoJSON and latitude/longitude coordinate pairs within
your collections, and visualizes them using interactive maps. The maps
also permit interactive query construction.

Viewing indexes
---------------

Switch to the Indexes tab to view the indexes of a collection.

.. figure:: /images/compass/index-view.png
  :figwidth: 740px

**Name and definition** of an index: The name of the index and
whether the index is ascending or descending.

**Type of index:** Regular, text, geospatial or hashed index.

**Size of index:** How large the index is.

**Usage of index:** Number of times the index has been used
since the time the index was created or the last server restart.

**Properties of index:** Whether there are any special properties
of the index.


Viewing documents
-----------------

Use the Documents tab to view individual documents. When the Documents
tab loads, Compass displays all documents that match your query criteria
(or all documents within the sample if no query criteria was
specified).
