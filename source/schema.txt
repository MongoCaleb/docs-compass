Schema Tab
----------

The :guilabel:`Schema` tab reports on the documents in the collections.
The report is based on :ref:`sampling of the documents
<compass-faq-sampling>` in the collection.

To access the :guilabel:`Schema` tab for a collection, click on a
collection on the left hand pane and select the :guilabel:`Schema` tab.

Query Bar
---------

From the query bar, you can specify:

.. list-table::

   * - .. data:: Filter

     - Filter for the schema view. To build a query using the query
       bar, see :ref:`query-collection`.

   * - .. data:: Limit

     - The upper limit for sampling. The maximum limit is 1000.

Charts
------

For a field, Compass displays the data types and values with various
charts. The data type information is on the left hand side; the field
value information is on the right.

Field with Single Type Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an example of a chart showing a field called ``last_login``
which contains data of type ``date``.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-example.png
   :figwidth: 330px

Field with Multiple Type Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The charts also display a percentage breakdown for fields with varying
data types across documents. In the example below,
the chart shows the contents of a field called ``phone_no`` in which
81% of documents are of type ``string``, and the remaining 19% are of
type ``number``.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-percentage-breakdown.png
   :figwidth: 330px

Missing Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a collection contains documents in which not all fields contain
a value, the missing values display as ``undefined``. In the example
below, the field ``age`` has no recorded value in 40% of the sampled
documents.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-sparsity.png
   :figwidth: 330px

Strings
~~~~~~~

Strings can appear in three different ways. If there are
entirely unique strings in a field, Compass shows a random
selection of string values from the specified field. Click
the circular refresh icon to see
a new set of randomly selected values from the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-sample.png
   :figwidth: 609px

If there are only a few different string values,
Compass shows the strings in a single graded bar which
shows the percentage of the population of the string values.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-sample2.png
   :figwidth: 620px

If there are multiple string values with some duplicates,
Compass shows a histogram indicating the frequency of
each string found within the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-sample3.png
   :figwidth: 764px

.. note::

   Move the mouse over each bar to display a tooltip which shows the
   value of the string.

Numbers
~~~~~~~

Numbers are similar to strings in their representation.
Entirely unique numbers are shown in the following manner:

.. figure:: /images/compass/number-sample.png
   :figwidth: 764px

Duplicate numbers are shown in a histogram that indicates their
frequency:

.. figure:: /images/compass/number-sample2.png
   :figwidth: 762px

Sub-documents and Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that contain a sub-document or an array are displayed with
a small triangle next to them and a visual representation of the
data contained within the sub-document or array.

.. figure:: /images/compass/subdocument-sample.png
   :figwidth: 572px

Click on the triangle to expand the field and view the sub-documents
within:

.. figure:: /images/compass/subdocument-sample2.png
   :figwidth: 639px

Dates and ObjectIDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that represent dates (and fields that contain the ObjectID
data type, which includes a timestamp) are shown across multiple
bar charts. The two charts on the top row represent the day of the
week and time of day of the timestamp value.

The single chart on the bottom shows the first and last timestamp
value, and the vertical lines represent the distribution of the
timestamp across the range of first to last.

.. figure:: /images/compass/date-sample.png
   :figwidth: 615px

View Charts of Mixed Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a field has mixed types, you can view different
charts of each type by clicking on the ``type`` field.
In the example below, the ``age`` field shows its values
as a string:

.. figure:: /images/compass/mixed-sample.png
   :figwidth: 602px

Clicking on the ``number`` type causes the chart to show
the data as a number:

.. _query-collection:

Query the Collection
--------------------

There are two methods for building queries in Compass. You can
automatically generate queries with the Compass query builder or you
can type the query manually in the filter bar.

Composing ``$OR`` queries is not yet possible with the clickable query
builder, but you can be manually enter them in the query bar.

.. tip::

   You can compose the initial query by using the clickable query
   builder and then manually edit the generated query to your exact
   requirements.

Use the Query Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Click on the chart value to build a query with the correct MongoDB syntax in the query bar.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The example shows the query filter built by clicking the **EWR**
value for the ``departureAirportFsCode`` field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-builder.png

2. Click on other field values to create a compound query. 
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The following example shows the compound query built by selecting a
value in the ``flightId`` field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-builder2.png


3. Select multiple values for the same field.
``````````````````````````````````````````````
 
Click and drag the cursor over a selection of values, or press
shift+click on the desired values.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-builder3.png

4. Remove selected fields from query filter.
````````````````````````````````````````````

You can also deselect a previously selected value by shift+clicking on
the selected value:

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-builder4.png
   :figwidth: 740px

5. Click the ``Apply`` button to view the updated results.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

To run the query, click the :guilabel:`Apply` button. You can clear
your query by pressing the :guilabel:`Reset` button.

Type the Query in the Filter Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Type the query you wish to run in the filter bar.
````````````````````````````````````````````````````

You can type MongoDB queries into the query bar of Compass. These
queries are executed as find only, and must be valid MongoDB syntax.

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-bar.png

The query bar will remain red until a valid query is entered, at
which point it will turn green and the query can proceed. The
Compass screen updates to indicate which field/value has been
selected in the query.

The results of the query are from a sampled set of documents, unless
the query is granular enough to provide results under the sample
threshold. In that case, the data from the entire result set is used.

.. note::

   - It is not possible to append a sort onto the end of your
     query from the Schema view.

   - Aggregation framework queries are not yet supported.

   - ``$text`` and ``$elemMatch`` are not yet supported.

   - Non-standard BSON types such as ``Timestamp`` and ``MinKey`` must be
     entered using strict
     :manual:`extended JSON </reference/mongodb-extended-json/>` syntax.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { foo : { $timestamp : { $t : 1234, $i : 12 } } }

2. Click the Apply button and view the updated results.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````

To run the query, click the :guilabel:`Apply` button. You can clear
your query by pressing the :guilabel:`Reset` button.

Geographic visualization and query builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compass detects GeoJSON and latitude/longitude coordinate pairs within
your collections, and visualizes them using interactive maps. The maps
also permit interactive query construction.
