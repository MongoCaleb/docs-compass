   The results of the query are from a sampled set of documents unless
   the query is granular enough to provide results under the sample
   threshold. In that case, the data from the entire result set is used.

   You can type MongoDB queries into the query bar. In the query
   expression, you can use the various MongoDB :manual:`query operators
   </reference/operator/query/>` except for the :query:`$text` query
   operator.

   As you type, the :guilabel:`Apply` button is disabled and the
   :guilabel:`Filter` label turns red until a valid query is entered.
   Filter syntax requires strict :manual:`extended JSON
   </reference/mongodb-extended-json/>` types. For details on using the
   query bar, see :ref:`querying`.
